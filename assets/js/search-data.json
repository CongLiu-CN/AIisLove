            "content": "In this lesson, he provides a summary of the chapter 8, which is listed as follows: . An end-to-end Scikit-Learn workflow | Getting the data ready | Choose the right estimator/algorithm for our problems | Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data | Evaluating a model | Improve a model | Save and load a trained model | Putting it all together | In this lesson, we focus only on the first section—An end-to-end Scikit-Learn workflow. This section is a brief overview of the entire chapter 8. Therefore, the content of this section can be a bit overwelming. There is no need to fully understand every points in this part. Its main purpose is only give students an opportunity to preview what they are going to learn later to better understand and use sklearn. . Daniel, the instructor of this course, shows every step of a common sklearn workflow in a simple version. Those steps are &quot;1. GET THE DATA READY&quot;, &quot;2. CHOOSE THE RIGHT MODEL AND HYPERPARAMETERS&quot;, &quot;3. FIT THE MODEL TO THE TRAINING DATA&quot;, &quot;4. EVALUATE THE MODEL ON THE TRAINING DATA AND TEST DATA&quot;, &quot;5. IMPROVE A MODEL&quot;, &quot;6. SAVE A MODEL AND LOAD IT&quot;. The last step in the list above is missing for unknown reasons. . 1. GET THE DATA READY . The first thing we need to do is not importing the data, but rather, importing some common libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. But for now, let&#39;s just import the first two. . import pandas as pd import numpy as np . You may ask what the hell is pandas or numpy? . Let me explain... . &quot;Pandas&quot; is a software library writtten for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. More specificly, it offers data structrues and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. . &quot;Numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimenstional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. . Hooo, that&#39;s a lot to take in, but we may be ok for now. . After we import pandas and numpy, let&#39;s import the heart disease data from Github: . heart_disease = pd.read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CongLiu-CN/zero-to-mastery-ml/master/data/heart-disease.csv&quot;) heart_disease.head() . age sex cp trestbps chol fbs restecg thalach exang oldpeak slope ca thal target . 0 63 | 1 | 3 | 145 | 233 | 1 | 0 | 150 | 0 | 2.3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | . 1 37 | 1 | 2 | 130 | 250 | 0 | 1 | 187 | 0 | 3.5 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | . 2 41 | 0 | 1 | 130 | 204 | 0 | 0 | 172 | 0 | 1.4 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | . 3 56 | 1 | 1 | 120 | 236 | 0 | 1 | 178 | 0 | 0.8 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | . 4 57 | 0 | 0 | 120 | 354 | 0 | 1 | 163 | 1 | 0.6 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | . ???????????Why do we need to split data into X &amp; y? . X = heart_disease.drop(&quot;target&quot;, axis=1) y = heart_disease[&quot;target&quot;] . 2. Choose the right model and hyperparameters . from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier clf = RandomForestClassifier() . # We&#39;ll keep the deafault hyperparameters clf.get_params() . {&#39;bootstrap&#39;: True, &#39;ccp_alpha&#39;: 0.0, &#39;class_weight&#39;: None, &#39;criterion&#39;: &#39;gini&#39;, &#39;max_depth&#39;: None, &#39;max_features&#39;: &#39;auto&#39;, &#39;max_leaf_nodes&#39;: None, &#39;max_samples&#39;: None, &#39;min_impurity_decrease&#39;: 0.0, &#39;min_impurity_split&#39;: None, &#39;min_samples_leaf&#39;: 1, &#39;min_samples_split&#39;: 2, &#39;min_weight_fraction_leaf&#39;: 0.0, &#39;n_estimators&#39;: 100, &#39;n_jobs&#39;: None, &#39;oob_score&#39;: False, &#39;random_state&#39;: None, &#39;verbose&#39;: 0, &#39;warm_start&#39;: False} . 3. Fit the model to the training data . from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2) . clf.fit(X_train, y_train); . # Make a prediction y_preds = clf.predict(X_test) y_preds . array([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], dtype=int64) . y_test . 256 0 24 1 266 0 294 0 131 1 .. 14 1 146 1 275 0 25 1 168 0 Name: target, Length: 61, dtype: int64 . 4. Evaluate the model on the training data and test data . clf.score(X_train, y_train) . 1.0 . clf.score(X_test, y_test) . 0.9016393442622951 . from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score . print(classification_report(y_test, y_preds)) . precision recall f1-score support 0 0.92 0.86 0.89 28 1 0.89 0.94 0.91 33 accuracy 0.90 61 macro avg 0.90 0.90 0.90 61 weighted avg 0.90 0.90 0.90 61 . confusion_matrix(y_test, y_preds) . array([[24, 4], [ 2, 31]], dtype=int64) . accuracy_score(y_test, y_preds) . 0.9016393442622951 . 5. Improve a model . Try different amount of n_estimators . np.random.seed(2020) . for i in range(10, 100, 10): print(f&quot;Trying model with {i} estimators...&quot;) clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=i).fit(X_train, y_train) print(f&quot;Model accuracy on test set: {clf.score(X_test, y_test)*100:.2f}%&quot;) print(&quot;&quot;) . Trying model with 10 estimators... Model accuracy on test set: 78.69% Trying model with 20 estimators... Model accuracy on test set: 90.16% Trying model with 30 estimators... Model accuracy on test set: 85.25% Trying model with 40 estimators... Model accuracy on test set: 88.52% Trying model with 50 estimators...

Model accuracy on test set: 86.89% Trying model with 80 estimators... Model accuracy on test set: 85.25% Trying model with 90 estimators... Model accuracy on test set: 91.80% . 6. Save a model and load it . import pickle . pickle.dump(clf, open(&quot;random_forest_model_1.pkl&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;)) . loaded_model = pickle.load(open(&quot;random_forest_model_1.pkl&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;)) loaded_model.score(X_test, y_test) # align with the last result . 0.9180327868852459 .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
